    "#Discuss the concept of method overloading in Python inheritance. How does it differ from method  overriding?\n",
    "''' In Python, method overloading is not supported in the traditional sense as it is in other object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C++.\n",
    "In those languages, method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. \n",
    "However, in Python, if you define a method with the same name as an already existing method, Python will replace the old method with the new method 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, method overriding is supported in Python. \n",
    "Method overriding is when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. \n",
    "When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters, and same return type (or subtype) as a method in its superclass,\n",
    "then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the superclass 23.\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of the method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it. \n",
    "If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed.\n",
    "But if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed. \n",
    "In other words, it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable) \n",

    "#Describe the concept of \"aggregation\" in composition and how it differs from simple composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Both aggregation and simple composition are concepts used in object-oriented programming to represent relationships between classes. \n",
    "They both involve combining objects together, but they differ in the strength and lifetime of their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes. \n",
    "The composed objects do not have an independent existence without the class that contains them. \n",
    "When an object is destroyed, all the objects it contains are also destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a `Car` class that contains objects of `Engine`, `Wheel`, and `Seat` classes. \n",
    "If the `Car` object is destroyed, its engine, wheels, and seats will also be destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation is a specialized form of association where one class is composed of one or more objects of other classes, \n",
    "but these objects can exist independently of the class that contains them. \n",
    "The objects can belong to multiple classes or exist beyond the lifetime of the containing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a `University` class might have a list of `Student` objects. \n",
    "However, students can exist independently of the university, and they might be associated with other entities like courses or programs even if \n",
    "they are not part of the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lifetime Dependency:** In composition, the lifetime of the contained objects is dependent on the lifetime of the containing object. \n",
    "In aggregation, the contained objects can exist independently of the containing object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ownership:** In composition, the containing object owns the contained objects. \n",
    "In aggregation, the contained objects might be shared among multiple classes or have their own ownership elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strong vs. Weak Relationship:** Composition represents a strong \"whole-part\" relationship where the parts are integral to the whole. \n",
    "Aggregation represents a weaker \"has-a\" relationship, where the objects are associated but can exist separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code, both composition and aggregation can be implemented similarly using object references. \n",
    "However, the key difference lies in the nature of the relationship and the ownership of the objects involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these concepts helps in designing more flexible and modular systems, choosing the appropriate relationship between \n",
    "classes based on their real-world connections and interactions.'''\n"
